(\textit  {a}) We varied the mean of the distribution for each prey parameter by manipulating the log-mean value (see Table 1 for parameter definitions and values), with each point representing the result of 1000 simulations. Solid points represent significant differences (KS-test: $P < 0.05$) from parameter values unaltered from measured values (Table 1). (\textit  {b}) Variation in escape probability was examined with respect to both escape speed and reaction distance. The same simulation results are shown with respect to changes in escape speed (\textit  {c}) and reaction distance (\textit  {d}). }}{1}}

These are the sample simulations from which survival probability was determined with respect to differences in parameter values for (\textit  {a}) juvenile predators (same simulations as in Fig. S1\textit  {a}) and (\textit  {b}) adult (same simulations as in Fig. 4\textit  {a}). The shapes of these curves are different from when they are presented as survival probability because a probability cannot exceed a value of unity. }}{2}}

Each point on this plot represent an approach by the predator with its corresponding speed. A value of 1 represents a successful capture by the predator; while a value of 0 represents a failed capture. A logistical regression was taken the for points present for juvenile predators (red) and adult predators (blue). For either predator, there was a greater chance of capturing prey when predators approached at a lower speed. }}{3}}
