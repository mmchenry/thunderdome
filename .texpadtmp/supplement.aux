(\textit  {a}) We varied the mean of the distribution for each prey parameter by manipulating the log-mean value (see Table 1 for parameter definitions and values), with each point representing the result of 1000 simulations. Solid points represent significant differences (KS-test: P < 0.05) from a 0\% change. (\textit  {b}) Variation in escape probability was examined with respect to both escape speed and reaction distance. The same simulation results are shown with respect to changes in escape speed (\textit  {c}) and reaction distance (\textit  {d}). }}{1}}

These are the sample simulations from which survival probability was determined with respect to differences in parameter values for (\textit  {a}) juvenile predators (same simulations as in Fig. S1\textit  {a}) and (\textit  {b}) adult (same simulations as in Fig. 4\textit  {a}). The shapes of these curves are different from when they are presented as survival probability because a probability cannot exceed a value of unity. }}{2}}
