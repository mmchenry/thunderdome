\caption{Sensitivity analysis of game model to examine the effects of parameter variation on escape probability for juvenile zebrafish. 
(\textit{a}) Varying the the mean of the distribution by manipulating the log-mean value (see Table 1 in main manuscript for parameter definitions and values), with each point representing the result of 1000 simulations. 
(\textit{b}) Variation in escape probability was examined with respect to both escape speed and response distance the same simulation results are shown with respect to changes in escape speed (\textit{c}) and response distance (\textit{d}).
